# Public: Represents a point in a buffer in row/column coordinates.
#
# Every public method that takes a point also accepts a *point-compatible*
# {Array}. This means a 2-element array containing {Number}s representing the
# row and column. So the following are equivalent:
#
# ```coffee
# new Point(1, 2)
# [1, 2] # Point compatible Array
# ```
module.exports =
class Point

  # Public: A zero-indexed {Number} representing the column of the {Point}.

  # Public: Convert any point-compatible object to a {Point}.
  #
  # * `object` This can be an object that's already a {Point}, in which case it's
  #   simply returned, or an array containing two {Number}s representing the
  #   row and column.
  # * `copy` An optional boolean indicating whether to force the copying of objects
  #   that are already points.
  #
  # Returns: A {Point} based on the given object.

  # Public: Build and return a new {Point} by traversing the rows and columns
  # specified by the given point.
  #
  # * `other` A {Point} providing the rows and columns to traverse by.
  #
  # This method differs from the direct, vector-style addition offered by
  # {::translate}. Rather than adding the rows and columns directly, it derives
  # the new point from traversing in "typewriter space". At the end of every row
  # traversed, a carriage return occurs that returns the columns to 0 before
  # continuing the traversal.
  #
  # ## Examples
  #
  # Traversing 0 rows, 2 columns:
  # `new Point(10, 5).traverse(new Point(0, 2)) # => [10, 7]`
  #
  # Traversing 2 rows, 2 columns. Note the columns reset from 0 before adding:
  # `new Point(10, 5).traverse(new Point(2, 2)) # => [12, 2]`
  #
  # Returns a {Point}.
